## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS library Routing Library
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For Http Requests

### What I learned
I learned and improved on a boatload of things while completing this project. Including but not limited to working with APIs, routing with the react router library, filtering data gotten from an API, working with CSS grid layouts and using react hooks more efficiently. I pretty proud of the code snippet below.

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading) {
      const filteredData = data.filter((country) => {
        let inRegion = false;
        let matchesSearch = false;
        if (region === "none") {
          inRegion = true;
        } else {
          inRegion = country.region.toLowerCase() === region;
        }
        if (searchParam === "") {
          matchesSearch = true;
        } else {
          matchesSearch = country.name.common
            .toLowerCase()
            .includes(searchParam.toLowerCase());
        }
        return inRegion && matchesSearch;
      });
      setLocalData(filteredData.length === 0 ? "no match" : filteredData);
    }
  }, [loading, region, searchParam]);
```
### Continued development
In future projects, I plan to become more proficient at consuming APIs. Also I plan to learn how to implement better user friendly animations in my websites.
